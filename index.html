      <h2>About Me!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi everyone! I'm William and I'm a junior web developer based in London. I specialise in web development and web design using the latest technologies; HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript ES6. I love learning new things with every project. Please take a
        look at my projects below and feel free to get in contact with me at w.ibikunle92@gmail.com

      <h3>Munch</h3>
      <p>
        Munch was a project that I worked on recently in which I had to create the website and design it according to my clients specification. To create this website I used basic HTML and CSS to hone my skills. I really enjoyed working on this
        project.

      <h3>Granular</h3>
      <p>
        Granular is a project I have been working on for quite sometime. Just like the previous project I had to design the website from scratch using Figma and developed it using Atom text editor. Working on Granular I practiced creating scroll
        effects & added a multi-column layout to the pricing page. I used this project to enhance my development skills.

      <h3>Last Studio</h3>
      <p>
        Last Studio is one of my favourite projects I have worked on as a junior developer so far. I was able to experiment with colours, typography & imagery. I also used some Javascript on this project to create background colour changes & an image
        lightbox.

      <h3>Javascript Slider</h3>
      <p>
        This javascript slider was a personal project to help me hone my ES6 skills. Here I practiced how to create and show random slides & explored the language constructs of objects, constants, lets, arrays and functions.
